### Install git on Mac OSX

1. [Video Tutorial][macgit-video]

For OS X 10.9 and higher, install Git for Mac by downloading and running the most
recent `mavericks` installer from this list.

After installing Git,
there will not be anything in your /Applications folder, as Git is a command line program.
For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8) use the most recent available installer
labelled `snow-leopard` available here.

### Create a GitHub account

Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public version of your
code on [github.com][github].
You will need a supported web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).

You will need an account at [github.com][github] for parts of the Git lesson.
Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage you to create a GitHub account
if you don't have one already. Please consider what personal information
you'd like to reveal. For example, you may want to review these instructions
for keeping your email address private provided at GitHub.
