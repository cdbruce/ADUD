Simplicity is the most powerful virtue that any process
can have. There is only one problem: it is kind of
difficult to keep it simple

There is nothing wrong with print statements.
Symbolic debuggers promote writing complex programs.
If you can't debug a program with simple print
statements your program may be already too complicated.

TOSS 8.2

Pair programming is a concept borrowed from
software engineering. But it disregards the fact that most
software engineers need to solve
far simpler and far better defined problems than scientists do.

Is there evidence that it works when thinking
about scientific problems? Is there evidence that it actually helps
rather than hinders people? And that both of them
will benefit when solving just one person's problems?
